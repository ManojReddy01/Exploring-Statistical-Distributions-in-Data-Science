### **Distributions Covered:**

1. **Normal Distribution**: Also known as the bell curve, this continuous probability distribution is symmetric about the mean and widely used in inferential statistics and natural data analysis.
2. **Binomial Distribution**: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has the same probability of success.
3. **Poisson Distribution**: Used to model the probability of a certain number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, assuming a constant mean rate and independence of events.
4. **Uniform Distribution**: Represents scenarios where every outcome within a specific range is equally likely. It can be either discrete or continuous.
